# AussieStrains
Repo for strain-level analyses of ubiquitous and abundant soil bacteria across Australia.\
Used 331 publicly available shotgun metagenomes from BASE.\
Ended up focusing on Bradyrhizobium due to its dominance.

## Repo Structure
The repo contains this README and 3 directories.\
/code contains two scripts. SelectSamples_BASE.R goes through the sample selection process. MainAnalysis.R contains the main analysis.\
/data contains the data files to run the two scripts.\
/FinalFigs contains the final figures for the manuscript
